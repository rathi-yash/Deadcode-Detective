# Deadcode Detective üîç

**Unmask the silent clutter in your JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python projects.**

Deadcode Detective is a sleek CLI tool that sniffs out unused code‚Äîthose forgotten functions, variables, and exports lurking in your codebase. Powered by `ts-prune` for JS/TS and `vulture` for Python, it delivers a clear, colorful report to help you keep your projects lean and clean.

## Why Use It?

Dead code slows you down‚Äîclogging reviews, bloating builds, and hiding bugs. Deadcode Detective makes cleanup a breeze:
- **Multi-Language**: Detects dead code in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python.
- **Fast & Simple**: Scans your project in seconds with minimal setup.
- **Pretty Output**: Color-coded reports that are easy on the eyes.
- **Actionable**: Pinpoints files, lines, and symbols to zap.

---

## Installation

Grab it from npm:

```bash
npm install -g deadcode-detective
```

### **Prerequisites**
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Install `ts-prune`:

```bash
npm install -g ts-prune
```

- **Python**: Install `vulture`:
```bash
pip install vulture
```

---

## Usage

Run the `detect` command with paths to scan:
```bash
deadcode-detective detect --py ./src/test/python --confidence 70
```

### **Options**
- `--js <path>`: Scan JavaScript/TypeScript files.
- `--py <path>`: Scan Python files.

---

## Example Output
```bash
üîé Dead Code Report:

‚ùó Found 2 unused items in JavaScript/TypeScript:
unused.js:
  - unusedFunction (line 2)
dateFormatter.ts:
  - formatDate (line 1)

‚ùó Found 1 unused item in Python:
script.py:
  - dead_function (line 5)
```

If no dead code is found, you‚Äôll see:
```bash
‚úÖ No dead code found!
```

## Limitations

For JavaScript projects without a tsconfig.json, Deadcode Detective provides limited detection using ts-prune. Use TypeScript or ES6 modules for full JavaScript support, or look for future updates with enhanced JS analysis.

---

## Try It Out

Clone the repo and test it on the included examples:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yash9/deadcode-detective.git
cd deadcode-detective
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli.js detect --js ./src/test/js --py ./src/test/python
```
The `src/test/` folder contains sample JS and Python files with dead code to play with.

---

## How It Works

- **JS/TS**: Uses `ts-prune` to analyze your `tsconfig.json`-driven project.
- **Python**: Leverages `vulture` with a 60% confidence threshold for reliable detection.
- **Magic**: A dash of TypeScript, commander, chalk, and ora for a smooth CLI experience.
